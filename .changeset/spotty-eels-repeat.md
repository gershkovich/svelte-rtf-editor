Images now work end to end in the editor. Pictures can be added by file upload (one or many at a time), clipboard paste, drag-and-drop or address; each is inserted as a figure with a description line below it. Selecting an image shows a frame with drag-to-resize corner handles, width presets and left/centre/right placement.

Images are embedded rather than linked: `htmlToRtf` now writes real `\pict` picture groups (`\pngblip`/`\jpegblip`, sized with `\picwgoal`/`\pichgoal`) instead of an `[Image: …]` text placeholder, and `rtfToHtml` decodes `\pict` data — including pictures wrapped in `{\*\shppict}` — back into images at their stored size, with their descriptions re-attached.

`htmlToRtf` output is also made safe to carry inside another format (an HL7 `OBX-5` field, a JSON string): the document is emitted on a single line with no CR or LF anywhere, and picture bytes are written as uppercase hex so a PNG starts with the `89504E470D0A1A0A` signature receivers match on. Inserted pictures are bounded by two new props, since RTF costs two characters per image byte: `maxImageEdge` (1600 px) scales them down, and `maxImageBytes` (512 KB) re-encodes anything still too heavy — PNG first so screenshots stay sharp, JPEG only when the image is large and has no transparency to lose, then progressively smaller — until it fits.
