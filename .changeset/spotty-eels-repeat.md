'svelte-rtf-editor': minor

Images now work end to end in the editor. Pictures can be added by file upload (one or many at a time), clipboard paste, drag-and-drop or address; each is inserted as a figure with a description line below it. Selecting an image shows a frame with drag-to-resize corner handles, width presets and left/centre/right placement.

Images are embedded rather than linked: `htmlToRtf` now writes real `\pict` picture groups (`\pngblip`/`\jpegblip`, sized with `\picwgoal`/`\pichgoal`) instead of an `[Image: …]` text placeholder, and `rtfToHtml` decodes `\pict` data — including pictures wrapped in `{\*\shppict}` — back into images at their stored size, with their descriptions re-attached.
